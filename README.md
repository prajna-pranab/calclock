# calclock
webapp to display UCC dates (see https://ucc.zone) and convert between UCC and Gregorian calendar dates.

This is a Progressive Web App (pwa) that is hosted at https://ucc.zone/apps/calclock/ and should offer
to install itself as a webapp if you visit that page.

It provides a graphical representation of dates in the Universal Celestial Calendar, a solar calendar,
tracking dates in the Great Year and system of Hindhu Yugas (as they were described by Sri Yukteshwar Giri.)
